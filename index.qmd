I am a Ph.D. student, fortunate enough to be advised by Dr. Jamie Sikora and part of the group QuantumCS@VT. My research lies at the intersection of quantum information theory and online learning techniques. Prior to joining Virginia Tech, I had completed my BTech in computer science and engineering from Maulana Abul Kalam Azad University of Technology, West Bengal, India. 


I am a sucker for jazz and post-rock. I also religiously play CS:GO (now CS2) and an avid meme connoisseur. I will also rarely turn down offers to have a Chipotle bowl.
